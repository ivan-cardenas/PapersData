            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This dataset paper presents a comprehensive compilation of indicators covering three major
domains: drinking water supply, urban heat, and housing provision. The data were system-
atically collected from a wide range of peer-reviewed papers to ensure a robust foundation
for both academic research and practical policy analysis. The dataset includes a total of XXX
indicators, each categorized and described. The indicators are organized into a relational
database format, which allows for easy access and manipulation. The dataset was collected
to facilitate cross-sectoral analysis, enabling researchers and practitioners to explore the
interconnections between these critical areas of urban planning.</p>
<p>The key indicators are described with clear definitions, calculation methodologies, and
data provenance information. Additionally, the dataset is organized in a relational SQL
database, allowing users to perform advanced queries, join operations, and custom analyses.
Potential applications span a variety of research areas, such as urban planning, environmental
impact assessment, public health, and socio-economic studies.</p>
<p>This abstract serves as a placeholder for the final summary. Users are encouraged to
cite this dataset paper and provide feedback to further improve its coverage and quality in
future updates.</p>
